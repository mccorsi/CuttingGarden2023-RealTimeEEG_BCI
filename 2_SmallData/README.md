## Abstract
Machine learning methods that are capable to decode brain states in single trial play a role not only in closed-loop neurotechnological systems such as brain-computer interfaces (BCI) but also allow to obtain immediate feedback for participants who participate in studies that address fundamental research. Training up such a decoding model typically requires labeled training data from an individual participant / BCI user that is obtained at the beginning of a session. Recording this data limits the duration of the following online  experiment or BCI application. In my talk I will first provide an overview of mitigations of this problem, that all have in common that they try to minimize the need for individual data for a novel user or session, before zooming into three recently developed classification methods for event-related potential data, that make use of domain-specific regularization to minimize the need of training data.
